# Text-Mining---Using-no-code-tool-Orange-
Text Mining is conducted on orange. It is an open-source data visualization, machine learning and data mining toolkit. I  have used the dataset of IMDB rating having 5000 data records. To perform Sentiment Analysis , I have used "Text Mining" widget which is an Add On feature in Orange. I have plotted the "word cloud" before and after pre processing of text data by removing the the "stopwords" and regexp(|\$|&amp;|\*|>|&lt;|). Word cloud displays tokens (word count = 38324) and their size denoting the frequency of the word. Also  have plotted the Heat Map of the sentiment analysis which includes segregation of the customers reviews into four categories (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Compound). The compound score shows the sum of positive, negative &amp; neutral scores which is then normalized between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). The more Compound score closer to +1 indicates the higher the positivity (liking) of the customer towards that movie.
